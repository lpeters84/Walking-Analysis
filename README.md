# Data Description
walk.mat is a matlab struct containing data collected from a single trial where the subject walks over four force plates wearing motion capture markers. The relevant data within walk.mat are the "Trajectories" struct - containg all data collected by the 3D markers, and the "Analog" struct - containing all the force and moment data from the force plates. \

static.mat is a matlab struct containing data collected from a single trial where the subject stands normally on a force.... TBD
